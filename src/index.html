                Experience the transformative power of deep tissue massage at Na Naa Thai Massage. This intensive technique targets chronic muscle tension and knots, providing relief and restoring mobility.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Our expert therapists use slow, deliberate strokes and firm pressure to reach deeper layers of muscle and fascia. We focus on problem areas, working through adhesions and scar tissue to alleviate persistent pain and stiffness. Unlike the gentler Swedish massage, deep tissue work is more intense and may cause slight discomfort, but the results are long-lasting. It's ideal for those with specific muscular issues, athletes, or anyone seeking to address deep-seated tension.

                Immerse yourself in the ancient healing art of traditional Thai massage at Na Naa Thai Massage. This unique technique, also known as "Thai yoga massage," combines acupressure, energy work, and assisted yoga postures to restore balance and vitality.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Our skilled practitioners use their hands, knees, legs, and feet to move you into a series of yoga-like stretches. Along with gentle pressure along energy lines, rhythmic compressions, and artful stretching, this massage style works to improve flexibility, reduce tension, and energise both body and mind. Unlike oil-based massages, Thai massage is performed on a padded mat with you fully clothed, allowing for a wide range of motion. It's an invigorating experience that leaves you feeling both relaxed and energised.

                        Should I eat before coming for a massage?

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    It's recommended to avoid eating for at least 90 minutes before your massage treatment. If necessary, only have a light meal. This is because digestion diverts blood flow to your digestive system, which can interfere with the massage's effectiveness and potentially cause discomfort. Staying hydrated is important, so feel free to drink water before your appointment.

                    The frequency of massages varies depending on individual needs, preferences, and budget. For optimal benefits, regular sessions are recommended. This can range from weekly appointments for those with chronic issues or high stress levels, to monthly sessions for general wellness maintenance. We can help you determine the best schedule for your needs.

                    For your safety and comfort, it's best to avoid massages if you're feeling unwell, have a fever, or a contagious skin condition. The first trimester of pregnancy is generally considered off-limits for massage. If you have a serious medical condition or are undergoing treatments like chemotherapy, please consult your healthcare provider before booking a massage.

                    I am working as a nail technician. I had severe back and neck pain from sitting every day. But today, even with just one massage, the pain is all gone. I'm lucky to have gotten to know her. I’m so grateful to her and will be visiting often. Nanaa is an amazing professional 😍😍
